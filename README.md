# Discord.py Bot

A simple discord.py bot script I found on my hard drive. I'm not using it so if it can help people go ahead and use it. I would recommend making sure the code is not deprecated as it is somewhat old.

## ⚙️ Installation

* Copy paste the source code on any selfhosted discord bot websites that support python
* Or run it locally with any software you want
